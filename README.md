# Hidden Message Challenge

This repository demonstrates a scenario involving a hidden message within a nested file structure.

**Scenario:**

1. A user clones this repository.
2. A hidden folder (`hidden_folder`) containing hidden files is created in the `etc` directory of their machine.
3. The user must navigate through the hidden file structure to find the encrypted message.
4. The user then returns to this website to decrypt and submit the message.
5. The submitted message is validated on the server.

**Files:**

*   `.gitignore`: Prevents the `hidden_folder` from being tracked by Git.
*   `hidden_folder/`: 
    *   `hidden_file1`: An empty file.
    *   `hidden_file2/`: 
        *   `hidden_file3`: Contains the encrypted message.

**Instructions:**

1. **Clone the repository:** 
   git clone <repository_url>
